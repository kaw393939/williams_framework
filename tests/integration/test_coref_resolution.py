"""Integration tests for coreference resolution (Story S6-601).

Tests the CorefResolver transformer that resolves pronouns to entities
using spaCy coreference capabilities and stores COREF_WITH relationships in Neo4j.

TDD Approach: RED-GREEN-REFACTOR
- Write failing tests first
- Implement CorefResolver to make tests pass
- Refactor for clarity and performance
- NO MOCKS: Real Neo4j, real spaCy

Coverage Target: 85%+
