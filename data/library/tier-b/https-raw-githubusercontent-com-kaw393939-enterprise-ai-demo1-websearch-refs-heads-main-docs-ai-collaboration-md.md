## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical First Thing: Claude's Knowledge Cutoff

**Claude's training data ends: April 2024**

This means Claude doesn't know about:
- OpenAI features released after April 2024 (like GPT-5 Pro, Sora 2, AgentKit!)
- Library updates after April 2024
- New APIs or breaking changes

### üî• ALWAYS Give Claude Fresh Documentation

**‚ú® WE'VE DONE THIS FOR YOU!**

This repo includes comprehensive research on all OpenAI tools as of **October 2025**:
- üìÑ [**OpenAI Tools Research (Oct 2025)**](openai_tools_research_oct2025.md)

**Tell Claude:**
```
"I'm building a project with OpenAI APIs.
- Please read the comprehensive research at:
docs/openai_tools_research_oct2025.md

This has all the latest tools including GPT-5 Pro, Sora 2, AgentKit, 
and updated documentation from October 2025."
```

**For additional/specific APIs, you can also:**

```bash
# Download latest docs from OpenAI
# Visit: https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference
# Save specific sections to docs/ folder
# (Note: references/ folder is in .gitignore for student clones)
```

**Why this matters:**
- Claude might suggest deprecated methods
- API parameters change frequently
- New features exist that Claude doesn't know about (GPT-5 Pro, Sora 2!)
- You'll waste time debugging outdated code
- The research document has October 2025 updates!

## ü§ù Partnership, Not Magic

### What Claude IS:
- ‚úÖ A pair programmer
- ‚úÖ A rubber duck that talks back
- ‚úÖ A pattern suggester
- ‚úÖ A syntax helper
- ‚úÖ A test generator

### What Claude IS NOT:
- ‚ùå A replacement for thinking
- ‚ùå Always correct
- ‚ùå Aware of your specific requirements
- ‚ùå Able to run your code
- ‚ùå Connected to the internet

**Golden Rule:** You're the architect, Claude is the construction crew.
