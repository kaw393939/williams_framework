# Neo4j Knowledge Graph - Strategic Decision Summary

**Date**: October 12, 2025  
**Decision**: Implement Neo4j provenance-first architecture before FastAPI streaming  
**Impact**: Foundational change affecting entire system  
**Timeline**: +6 weeks, but avoids complete rebuild

---

## 🎯 The Question

Should we implement **Neo4j knowledge graph with provenance tracking** before or after the **FastAPI real-time streaming**?

---

## 📋 TL;DR Recommendation

**Implement Neo4j BEFORE FastAPI** (Sprints 5-6, then Sprint 7 for FastAPI)

**Why**: The Neo4j architecture fundamentally changes the ingestion pipeline. Building FastAPI streaming for the current simple pipeline, then rebuilding it for the Neo4j pipeline, wastes 40 tests and ~2,000 lines of code.

## 💡 What Neo4j Brings

### Today (Sprints 1-4 - Complete)
```
URL → Extract → Transform → Load → Qdrant vectors + MinIO files
```
**Capabilities**: Basic semantic search, quality tiers, file storage

### Tomorrow (Sprints 5-7 - Proposed)
```
URL → Fetch → Chunk → Coref → NER → Link → Relations → Embed → Neo4j graph
```
**New Capabilities**:
1. **Entity Recognition**: Identify people, organizations, places, laws, dates
2. **Entity Linking**: Canonical IDs (e.g., "OpenAI" = "Open AI" = "E:ORG:openai")
3. **Coreference**: Resolve "he/she/it" to actual entities
4. **Relationships**: Extract EMPLOYED_BY, FOUNDED, CITES, AUTHORED
5. **Provenance**: Full lineage from answer → chunk → entity → source
6. **Clickable Citations**: Byte offsets, page numbers, bounding boxes
7. **Knowledge Graph**: Visualize entity relationships
8. **"Explain This Answer"**: Export reasoning subgraphs

## 🗺️ Two Paths Forward

### Path A: FastAPI First → Neo4j Later (NOT RECOMMENDED)

```
Sprint 5: FastAPI for OLD pipeline (2 weeks)
   ↓
Sprint 6-7: Build Neo4j (4 weeks)
   ↓
Sprint 8: REBUILD FastAPI for NEW pipeline (2 weeks) ⚠️ REWORK
───────────────────────────────────────────
Total: 8 weeks, 173 tests, ~10k LOC
Waste: 2 weeks, 40 tests, ~2k LOC
```

**Pros**:
- ✅ See UI progress faster (2 weeks)
- ✅ Incremental visible value

**Cons**:
- ❌ Complete FastAPI rebuild required
- ❌ Longer total timeline (8 weeks vs 7)
- ❌ More total code (~10k vs ~8k)
- ❌ Wasted effort (40 tests thrown away)

---

### Path B: Neo4j First → FastAPI Once (RECOMMENDED)

```
Sprint 5: Neo4j Foundation + NER (2 weeks)
   ↓
Sprint 6: Entity Linking + Relations (2 weeks)
   ↓
Sprint 7: FastAPI for NEW pipeline (2 weeks) ✅ BUILT ONCE
───────────────────────────────────────────
Total: 6 weeks, 133 tests, ~8k LOC
Waste: None
```

**Pros**:
- ✅ No rework (FastAPI built once, correctly)
- ✅ Shorter total timeline (6 weeks vs 8)
- ✅ Less total code (~8k vs ~10k)
- ✅ Foundation correct from start
- ✅ Better architecture (no compromises)

**Cons**:
- ⚠️ No visible UI progress for 4 weeks
- ⚠️ Higher initial complexity

## 🤝 Discussion Points

### Technical Questions

1. **Neo4j Edition**: Community (free) or Enterprise (paid)?
   - **Recommendation**: Community sufficient for single-user/local

2. **Vector Store**: Neo4j-only or Neo4j + Qdrant hybrid?
   - **Recommendation**: Neo4j-only for MVP, Qdrant optional later

3. **NER Model**: SpaCy transformer or statistical?
   - **Recommendation**: Transformer (higher accuracy, worth slower speed)

4. **Coref Model**: Which library?
   - **Recommendation**: AllenNLP neuralcoref or Hugging Face model

5. **Relation Types**: Which to start with?
   - **Recommendation**: EMPLOYED_BY, FOUNDED, CITES, AUTHORED (expandable)

---

### Strategic Questions

1. **Priority**: Foundation vs. Speed?
   - Neo4j first = stronger foundation
   - FastAPI first = faster visible progress

2. **User Value**: Citations vs. Real-time progress?
   - Citations = unique differentiation
   - Real-time = better UX
   - **Both important, citations win for MVP**

3. **Complexity**: Are we ready for this?
   - Yes, we have TDD discipline (98% coverage)
   - Yes, we have real integration test patterns
   - Yes, phased approach reduces risk

4. **Timeline**: Can we afford 6 weeks?
   - Alternative (FastAPI first) takes 8 weeks total
   - Neo4j first is actually faster end-to-end

---

### Product Questions

1. **Demo Dataset**: What to showcase?
   - **Recommendation**: AI research papers (GPT, transformers, etc.)
   - Aligns with business plan (AI researchers as target users)

2. **Graph Visualization**: Which library?
   - **Recommendation**: D3.js (flexible) or Plotly (simpler)
   - Start with simple node-link diagram

3. **Citation UI**: How to display?
   - PDF: Highlight bounding box overlay
   - HTML: Scroll to anchor and highlight span
   - Both need page_map.json from ingestion

---

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

We proceed with Neo4j-first approach if we agree:

- ✅ Provenance + citations are **core differentiators** (not nice-to-have)
- ✅ Knowledge graph is **strategic vision** (not premature optimization)
- ✅ 6 weeks acceptable (vs 8 weeks with rework)
- ✅ Team has capacity for complexity (TDD mitigates risk)
- ✅ Docker setup straightforward (Neo4j 5.x works)
- ✅ Willing to defer visible UI for better foundation
