# Sprint 6: Entity Linking + Relations + RAG Citations - TDD Implementation Plan

**Duration:** 2 weeks (10 working days)  
**Focus:** Coreference resolution, entity linking to canonical IDs, relation extraction, RAG with citations  
**Testing Philosophy:** RED-GREEN-REFACTOR with real services (no mocks)  
**Target:** 49 new tests, maintain 98%+ coverage

---

## 🎯 Sprint Goals

1. **Coreference Resolution**: Resolve "he/she/it" pronouns to actual entities (e.g., "he founded it" → Sam Altman founded OpenAI)
2. **Entity Linking**: Link entity mentions to canonical Entity nodes with confidence scores
3. **Relation Extraction**: Discover EMPLOYED_BY, FOUNDED, CITES, LOCATED_IN relationships between entities
4. **RAG with Citations**: Answer questions with [1], [2], [3] citations linking to exact source text
5. **Graph Traversal**: Query entity relationships and reasoning paths

    assert result[0]["count"] == 1  # FAILS - might have duplicates
    assert result[0]["confidence"] > 0.9  # Aggregated confidence
    
# GREEN: Implement deduplication logic
# Use MERGE instead of CREATE, update confidence if relation exists

### **Day 10: Documentation & Sprint Review**

**Morning: Documentation**

**Tasks:**
1. ✅ Update README with knowledge graph features
2. ✅ Document entity linking algorithm
3. ✅ Document relation extraction patterns
4. ✅ Create Sprint 6 completion report

**Documentation Updates:**
```markdown
# docs/knowledge-graph-architecture.md

## Knowledge Graph Architecture

### Entity Linking
Williams AI uses a multi-stage entity linking pipeline:

1. **Mention Extraction**: SpaCy NER extracts entity mentions
2. **Coreference Resolution**: AllenNLP resolves pronouns to entities
3. **Fuzzy Matching**: Group similar mentions (e.g., "OpenAI" and "Open AI")
4. **Canonical Entity Creation**: Create Entity nodes with canonical names
5. **Link Mentions**: Connect Mention → Entity with confidence scores
6. **Cross-Document Deduplication**: Same entity across documents → one Entity node

### Relation Extraction
Pattern-based extraction using SpaCy dependency parsing:

**Supported Relations:**
- **EMPLOYED_BY**: "X works at Y", "X joined Y"
- **FOUNDED**: "X founded Y", "X started Y"
- **CITES**: "According to X", "X said"
- **LOCATED_IN**: "X in Y", "X based in Y"

**Custom Patterns:**
Add patterns in `config/relation_patterns.yml`

### RAG with Citations
1. User query → vector search in Neo4j
2. Retrieve relevant chunks with provenance
3. Build LLM prompt with citation IDs [1], [2], [3]
4. LLM generates answer with inline citations
5. User clicks citation → highlight exact quote in source

### Explainable AI
"Explain this answer" shows:
- Entities mentioned in answer
- Relationships between entities
- Graph visualization (D3.js)
- Source chunks for each claim
```

**Afternoon: Sprint Review**

**Sprint 6 Metrics:**
- ✅ 49 tests added (target: 49)
- ✅ Coverage: 98.5% (maintained 98%+ target)
- ✅ All stories completed
- ✅ Coreference resolution functional
- ✅ Entity linking with fuzzy matching
- ✅ 4 relation types extracted
- ✅ RAG with citations working
- ✅ Explainable AI implemented

**Demo Preparation:**
1. Ingest sample document about OpenAI
2. Query: "Who founded OpenAI?"
3. Show answer with citations [1], [2]
4. Click citation → see exact quote
5. "Explain this answer" → show graph visualization

**Commit:**
```
