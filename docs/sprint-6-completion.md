- **Sorting:** sort_by (relevance, date, title), sort_order (asc, desc)
- **Filtering:**
  - date_from, date_to (date range filtering)
  - min_relevance threshold
- **LLM Integration:** Prompt engineering with context and citation instructions

### âœ… S6-605: Graph Reasoning Queries (5/5 tests) - COMPLETE
**Purpose:** Advanced graph traversal and reasoning capabilities  
**Key Features:**

  - Filter by relationship type
  - Pagination support (page, page_size)
- **Path Finding:**
  - Shortest paths between entities
  - Configurable max_depth (prevent infinite loops)
  - max_paths limit
- **"Explain this Answer":**
  - Return reasoning subgraph with evidence
  - Show nodes and edges supporting the answer
  - Entity count tracking
- **Related Entity Discovery:**
  - Find entities related to a given entity
  - Filter by entity type (PERSON, ORG, GPE, etc.)
  - Sorting by confidence or text
- **Graph Traversal:**
  - Breadth-first or depth-first traversal
  - Configurable depth limits
  - Subgraph extraction with node/edge counts

**Files Created:**
- `tests/integration/test_graph_reasoning.py` (5 tests, 280+ lines)
- `app/services/graph_reasoning_service.py` (240+ lines)

**Key Cypher Queries:**
```cypher
# Entity relationships with pagination
MATCH (e:Entity {text: $entity_text})-[r]->(target:Entity)
RETURN type(r), target, r.confidence
ORDER BY r.confidence DESC
SKIP $skip LIMIT $limit

# Shortest path finding
MATCH path = shortestPath((e1:Entity {text: $start})-[*..5]-(e2:Entity {text: $end}))
RETURN nodes(path), relationships(path)

# Graph traversal with depth limit
MATCH path = (start:Entity {text: $start_entity})-[*..3]-(connected:Entity)
RETURN nodes(path), relationships(path), length(path)
```

## Pagination Architecture (Key Innovation)

**Standardized Pattern Across All Services:**
```python
def query_method(
    # Core parameters
    query_param: str,
    # Pagination
    page: int = 1,
    page_size: int = 10,
    # Sorting
    sort_by: str = "relevance",
    sort_order: str = "desc",
    # Filtering
    date_from: str | None = None,
    entity_type_filter: str | None = None,
    min_threshold: float = 0.0
) -> dict:
    return {
        "results": [...],
        "total_count": total,
        "page": page,
        "page_size": page_size,
        "total_pages": (total + page_size - 1) // page_size
    }
```

**Benefits:**
- Consistent API across CitationService, SearchService, GraphReasoningService
- Easy UI integration (total_count for page calculations)
- Scalable to large datasets (thousands of documents/citations)
- Flexible sorting with multiple fields
- Rich filtering capabilities
- No technical debt from retrofitting pagination later

## Bug Fixes

### Issue 1: Type Hint Error in SearchService
**Symptom:** `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for |: 'builtin_function_or_method' and 'NoneType'`  
**Root Cause:** Used `any` instead of `Any` in type hints  
**Solution:** Changed to `from typing import Any` and used `Any | None`  
**Files Fixed:** `app/services/search_service.py`

### Issue 2: Missing doc_id in Chunk Retrieval
**Symptom:** `citation["doc_url"]` returning empty string  
**Root Cause:** `get_chunk()` only returned chunk node, not the PART_OF relationship to document  
**Solution:** Updated Cypher query to include `OPTIONAL MATCH (c)-[:PART_OF]->(d:Document)` and return `d.id as doc_id`  
**Files Fixed:** `app/repositories/neo_repository.py`

### Issue 3: Graph Traversal Test with No Relationships
**Symptom:** `assert len(subgraph["nodes"]) >= 2` failing with 0 nodes  
**Root Cause:** Test created entities but didn't create relationships between them  
**Solution:** Updated test to use RelationExtractionService to create FOUNDED relationships in a chain (Aâ†’Bâ†’Câ†’D)  
**Files Fixed:** `tests/integration/test_graph_reasoning.py`

2. `LINKED_TO` - canonical entity linking
3. `EMPLOYED_BY` - employment relationships
4. `FOUNDED` - founding relationships
5. `CITES` - citation relationships
6. `LOCATED_IN` - location relationships

### ETL Pipeline Transformers:
1. `CorefResolver` - automatic pronoun resolution
2. `RelationExtractor` - automatic relation extraction

### Service Dependencies:
```
SearchService â†’ CitationService â†’ NeoRepository
                 â†“
              LLM Provider

GraphReasoningService â†’ NeoRepository

RelationExtractionService â†’ NeoRepository
                            â†“

   - Community detection for entity clustering
   - Influence propagation analysis

3. **Citation Improvements:**
   - PDF page snapshots
   - Highlight extraction with context

4. **Performance Optimizations:**
   - Neo4j index optimization
   - Query caching with Redis
   - Parallel batch processing

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Design Pagination Early
User feedback: "we should probably make sure we have anything we need for pagination in the future and sorting etc..."

**Decision:** Built pagination/sorting/filtering into the foundation of all services from day 1.

**Payoff:** The system is now ready to scale to thousands of documents and citations without architectural changes. This avoided significant technical debt.

### 2. Integration Tests with Real Services
All tests use real Neo4j, no mocks. This caught:
- Missing `doc_id` in chunk retrieval
- Type hint errors in service signatures
- Cypher query syntax issues

**Result:** Higher confidence that the system works end-to-end.

### 3. Relationship Extraction Needs Real Text
Pattern-based extraction works well for:
- Employment: "works at", "employed by"
- Founding: "founded", "co-founded"
- Citations: "according to", "referenced"
- Locations: "based in", "located in"

**Future:** Could enhance with transformer-based extraction for more complex relationships.
