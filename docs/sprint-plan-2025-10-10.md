## 13. Tracking & Update Protocol
- **Status markers:** use `[ ]` (not started), `[~]` (in progress), `[x]` (done) inside each story row. Update during standups or whenever work begins/ends.
- **Sprint Scoreboard:** at planning, populate `Committed Stories` and add health notes. Mid-sprint, adjust `Health` (ðŸŸ¢ / ðŸŸ¡ / ðŸ”´) and record carry-over risk.
- **Progress Log:** every material change (new red test, green build, blocker) gets a dated entry referencing sprint and story ID.
- **Definition of Done:** before marking `[x]`, confirm tests in the "Tests to Write First" column exist and pass, docs are updated, and coverage remains â‰¥90%.
- **Change control:** when scope shifts, edit both this sprint plan and `docs/tdd-plan-2025-10-10.md` in the same session so documentation stays aligned.
